<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ribbon Fiber Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ribbon fiber cables market is categorized into two main types: single-mode and multi-mode fibers. Single-mode fibers feature a small core diameter, allowing only one light mode to propagate, which results in higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances, making them ideal for telecommunications and long-haul networks. In contrast, multi-mode fibers have a larger core, enabling multiple light modes, thus supporting shorter distances and higher data rates, making them suitable for data centers and local area networks. Both types cater to diverse communication needs.</p></p>
